Sudoku Solver using Backtracking
Author: Mohit Kourav

Description:
A Python implementation to solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.
Includes:
- Line-by-line code explanation
- Example input/output
- Time and Space complexity analysis

    Solve the Sudoku board using backtracking.
    
    How it works:
    1. Iterate over each cell in the 9x9 board.
    2. Find the first empty cell (denoted by 0).
    3. Try placing numbers 1-9 in that cell.
    4. If placing a number is valid (checked by is_valid), recurse to next empty cell.
    5. If no number fits, backtrack by resetting cell to 0.
    6. Continue until all cells are filled.
    
    Returns True if solved, False if no solution exists.

    Time & Space Complexity:
    ---------------------------------
    Time Complexity: O(9^(N*N)) worst-case
        - N = 9 for standard Sudoku board
        - Each empty cell tries numbers 1-9, potentially recursively for all empty cells
    Space Complexity: O(N*N)
        - Board storage and recursion stack
    Practical performance:
        - Usually much faster because Sudoku puzzles have enough initial clues to limit recursion.
